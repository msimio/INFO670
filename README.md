React Native Grocery List App

This app is designed for shoppers who want a quick and easy way to create and edit a list of items that they need to buy at the grocery store.

Users simply enter the item into the text field and press the "Add Item" button to add the items to the list.

Each item has an "Edit" button which will allow the user to Edit the entry and resubmit with the "Add" button, as well as a "Delete" button which will remove the item from the list.
