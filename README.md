# Design and Purpose

This app was designed to display a small thumbnail photo gallery with the option to expand the photos to a larger view. This app demonstrates the use of Tab Navigation and Stack Navigation and uses local storage to save a user profile. The stack navigation includes a back button for when the user navigates to the larger image view page. This app uses React Native Paper for styling and components including View, Text, Image, BottomNavigation, SelectList and more.
